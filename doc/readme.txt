Readme for X-IvAp

Installation

Just copy the contents of the for_plugins_folder into the Resources/plugins
folder of your X-Plane installation directory. To avoid conflicts you should
disable the XSquawkBox and IVAORW plugins while you are using X-IvAp. 


The project homepage can be found at http://www.ivao.aero/softdev/X-IvAp
The suppport forum (requires registration): http://forum.ivao.aero/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=304



If you are new to X-IvAp, take a look at the introduction!

Additional information (manuals, instructions, etc.) can be found at
http://www.ivao.aero/softdev/X-IvAp/manual.htm. (Be aware, this page
is probably outdated. I'm looking for volunteers to write a new one)



Have fun on IVAO!
